espn ui issues resolved: 
-no ads
-start/sit stats irrelevant (hive mind)
-see owner name not silly team name, faster trade process
-use data how i want (speed research time)
-such as evaluating players based on projections differential over multiple years
-or which players or demographics play better late season
-access to data on rpi and enable future voice integration
-able to offer knowledgable stats in trade negotiations
-improved relationships with friends as a result (high school buddies)
